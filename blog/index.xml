Device Tree Overlays With my current workflow structure, I do not come across Device tree overlays very often as usually, the PetaLinux build is bespoke to the task at hand.</description></item><item><title>Life: Vitis AI Libraries, ROS2, New Addition</title><link>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/life-vitis-ai-libraries-ros2-new-addition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/life-vitis-ai-libraries-ros2-new-addition/</guid><description>Life: Vitis AI Libraries, ROS2, New Addition This weeks life update continues my adventure with Xilinx KV260. The focus this week is the Vitis AI Libraries and implementing these onto the KV260. A huge inspiration in my life hits the 30-year milestone, and our new addition arrives.
Vitis AI Libraries Work started this week on implementing the Vitis AI Libraries onto the KV260. My first observation was that the Vitis AI Libraries were missing from the latest toolchain.</description></item><item><title>Life: FPGA Work, Huel, Future Thoughts</title><link>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/life-fpga-work-huel-future-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/life-fpga-work-huel-future-thoughts/</guid><description>Life: FPGA Work, Huel, Future Thoughts This post is just a little weekly round-up of what I have been up to, thoughts and processes I have been working on, and any good and bad life choices.
FPGA Work This week has been constant. With the release of the Kria board, the race is on to start adapting current processes to work. My current job supports Intel RealSense for computer vision work, so the need for this to be available on the Kria board is paramount.</description></item><item><title>Kria: Initial Thoughts</title><link>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/kria-intial-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/kria-intial-thoughts/</guid><description>Kria: Initial Thoughts Kria Recently released the Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit, a SOM with the added benefit of a FPGA. Different in the fact that you should technically be able to add a 12v power supply and run AI models to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content.
Inital Thoughts I like the Design of the Kria carrier board it has plenty of IO available. up to 32 concurrent streams are possible through a number of IAS and CSI camera connections.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jackbonnelldevelopment.github.io/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello World First ever blog woohoo! keep checking back for any updates my thoughts on tech, food, tech companies etc</description></item></channel></rss>
